## Hello!
### Here is the repo with Computer vision tasks I study.

Next folders contain code and results for their tasks:
- Pan sharpening
- Classification
- Object Detection
- Segmentation
- Metric Learning
- Tracking

Structure inside each folder is like this:
- src - folder with the code
- results.md - file with presented results: metrics and image examples
- data - some files like images for results and/or additional files for the models

## For example:

In Object detection task I was detecting rhinoceros and hippopotamus on images.
